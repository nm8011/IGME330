Tell us about the 2 Audio Effect nodes you added to the audio routing graph.
    I did not add 2 audio effect nodes
III. Tell us your Sprite's class name, what it looks like/what it does in the visualization
    My sprite's class name is PhylloFlower, it should look like a spiralling flower with it spiralling changing due to audio, I could not get it to work
IV. Tell us what app data you put in your av-data.json file
    I put the title of the app, audioFile, audioFileName, direction, and features of the app
V. Tell us how you improved the aesthetics of the app over the AV HW:
    I made the gradient less vivid(popping out at your face)
    I added a white ring to the circle
    There was suppose to be a spiralling flower to the right and left of the circle
    I would give myself a 10% grade, I couldve definitely made more improvement and made it look more advance according to my skill level
