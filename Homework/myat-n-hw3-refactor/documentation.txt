Tell us about the 2 Audio Effect nodes you added to the audio routing graph.
    I added 3 Audio effect nodes
    I added the treble, bass and distortion
    The treble produces a high sound
    The bass produces a low sound
    The distortion adds an interference to the sound that imitates distortion
III. Tell us your Sprite's class name, what it looks like/what it does in the visualization
    My sprite's class name is Coin, it should look like a spinning coin. I could not get it to work
IV. Tell us what app data you put in your av-data.json file
    I put the title of the app, audioFile, audioFileName, direction, and features of the app
V. Tell us how you improved the aesthetics of the app over the AV HW:
    I made the gradient less vivid(popping out at your face)
    I made the gradient spin and doesnt stop b/c it'd look ugly otherwise
    I added a white ring to the circle that changes based on sound
    I added a staticy line that fluctuates according to the music
    I made that line spine so it looks like it produces lightning
    I made a circle bars that changes according to the sound
    All the changes in Show Spinning Line stops spinning when music is first paused and the blue line disappears
    There was suppose to be a spinning coin to the right and left of the circle
    I would give myself a 14% grade, I couldve definitely made more improvement and made it look more advance according to my skill level
    I could not get the sprite to work no matter what which reveals to me that its something I definitely have to review
